This repository contains my programming projects for the CS 2050 Computer Science 2 that I took at MSU Denver in Summer of 2018. Below is a general description about what each programming projects is about. The programs in this repository is written in Python with version 2.

[Assignment 1](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%202050%20Computer%20Science%202%20(Summer%202018)/Assignment%201) :

Is about creating a linked list where each of the nodes contained numeric values that could be accessed, modified as well as nodes could be pushed onto or popped off of the linked list. The assignment included writing various unit tests to ensure that the linked list was working properly.

[Assignment 2](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%202050%20Computer%20Science%202%20(Summer%202018)/Assignment%202) :

Is about implementing a dictionary using chaining where every key has a hash and unit tests were written and used to ensure that it worked.

[Assignment 3](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%202050%20Computer%20Science%202%20(Summer%202018)/Assignment%203) :

Is about writing a recursive method that takes:  

1) A string to find 

2) A string to replace the found string with

3) An initial string. 

4) And returns the initial string with all the found strings replaced with the replacement string. Where loops and the built-in string methods are not used with the exception of comparison, length, and slicing.

5) The resursive method also had associated unit tests written for it to test the methods accuracy.

[Assignment 4](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%202050%20Computer%20Science%202%20(Summer%202018)/Assignment%204) :

Is about creating a program that creates and navigates a binary tree that has written unit tests to ensure that the binary tree has both been properly created as well as to ensure that the navigation of the binary tree to find values is properly occuring.
