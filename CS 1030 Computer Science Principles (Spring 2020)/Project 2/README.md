**PROJECT TITLE:** Project 2

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

Consists of two separate programs. 

The first program computes a grade point average when at least one grade is given and the name of this program is [AdamSchaible_03_02_01.py](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%202/AdamSchaible_03_02_01.py).

The second program is a coin flipping program that counts the number of times a coin is flipped in order to get either three heads or three tails in a row and displays the average number of flips, the minimum number of flips and maximum number of flips based on how many coin flipping simulations the user tells the program to run. The name of this second program is [AdamSchaible_03_02_02.py](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%202/AdamSchaible_03_02_02.py).
