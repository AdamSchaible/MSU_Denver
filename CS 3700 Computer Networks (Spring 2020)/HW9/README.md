**HOMEWORK TITLE:** Homework 9

**HOMEWORK DESCRIPTION:**

Was about writing a program that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to generate the forwarding table for the source router that results in the the shortest router path from the source router to a destination router in a network. The forwarding table is derived from a text file that contains the cost of traveling from one router to its neighboring routers. At the end of the program the forwarding table is displayed. This program is written in Python.
