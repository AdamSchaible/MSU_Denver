**USER INSTRUCTIONS:** 

1) Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if you do not allready have Java Development Kit 8 or a latter version allready installed on your computer. For installation help see [Oracle's Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2) If you are unfamiliar with running Java programs first go to [How to Compile and Run your First Java Program](https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/first-java-program/).

Note: The server will need to be started before the client, otherwise the client will not be able to find the server.

On the server side run the following commands in your terminal or command line in the directory containing the Java file UDPServer.java to run the program:

javac UDPServer.java
java UDPServer

On the client side run the following commands in your terminal or command line in the directory containing the Java file UDPClient.java to run the program:

javac UDPClient.java
java UDPClient
