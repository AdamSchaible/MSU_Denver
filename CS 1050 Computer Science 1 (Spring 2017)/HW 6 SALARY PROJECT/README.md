**HOMEWORK TITLE:** HW 6 SALARY PROJECT

**HOMEWORK DESCRIPTION:**
To write a java program that calculates a workers salary in dollars. The user enters the number of days that they worked and it is assumed that the worker earns one penny for the first day and for each following day that days wage is double the previous day. For each day display the current wage and the total accumulation of money earned by the worker. Use integers for the days worked, daily salary and total pay.

**PROBLEMS THAT NEED ADDRESSING:** 
1) With no restrictions on total pay in the project requirements the total pay can easily exceed the maximum value of an integer.

2) There are no safeguards that prevent the user from entering something other than an integer, which the entering of something other than an integer would generate an error and crash the program.
