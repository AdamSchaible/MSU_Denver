**PROJECT TITLE:** Project 1

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

Consists of three separate programs. 

The first program converts a height in feet to meters and is named [AdamSchaible_03_01_01.py](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%201/AdamSchaible_03_01_01.py).

The second program converts miles per gallon to kilometers per liter and is named [AdamSchaible_03_01_02.py](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%201/AdamSchaible_03_01_02.py).

The third program outputs the color of a square on a chessboard when given a chessboard coordinate and is named [AdamSchaible_03_01_03.py](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%201/AdamSchaible_03_01_03.py).

The full project description and requirements are in [1030 Project 01 Specification - V02.pdf](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%201/1030%20Project%2001%20Specification%20-%20V02.pdf).

All files related to this project are contained in this directory.

**VERSION or DATE:** 2/13/2020

**USER INSTRUCTIONS:** 
1) Install Python 3 if not allready installed then follow the installation instructions from the article ["Install Python 3"](https://installpython3.com/).

2) First open your terminal or command line in the directory containing this README file. In either your terminal or command line run the python program of your preference by typing python3 followed by the full name of the python program that you wish to run, e.g. python3 hello.py followed by enter. If you need assistance running python programs then go to ["How to Run Your Python Scripts"](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/) .

To run the first program use the command:
python3 AdamSchaible_03_01_01.py

To run the second program use the command:
python3 AdamSchaible_03_01_02.py

To run the third program use the command:
python3 AdamSchaible_03_01_03.py

**PROBLEMS THAT NEED ADDRESSING:** These programs allow for users to enter in incorrect inputs, which would result in an unhandled exception. Having the program be resistant to these types of errors was not part of the requirements for this project.
