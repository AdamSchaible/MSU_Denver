**PROJECT TITLE:** Project 2

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

Consists of several small programs that are written in Lisp. Programs include the following.

1) Program that computes the factorial of a positive integer

2) Program that tells you how many times a number is in a list

3) Program that tells you how many numbers in a list are divisible by 3

4) Program that tells you whether your list has duplicates

5) Program that removes all negatives from a list and returns that list.

6) Program that converts Celcius to Fahrenheit or vice versa

7) Program that counts groups when given a list of words and / or numbers, not nested, counts the number of groups (a group is two or more identical adjacent items).

8) Program that sorts by recency. Takes a word and a list of words, not nested. If the word is not in the list, it is added at the beginning of the list.  If the word is in the list, its position is changed to be first in the list.

9) Program that compares numbers in a list to an upper limit. If the number in the list is above the limit then that number is replaced by the limit.

10) Program that doubles all elements in a list

11) Program that acts as a syntax checker for an incoming list, for details on all of the syntax rules that are checked follow the Project link for more information.
