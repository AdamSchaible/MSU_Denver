**HOMEWORK TITLE:** HW 8 BANK

**HOMEWORK DESCRIPTION:**
Write a java program named [AccountApplication.java](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201050%20Computer%20Science%201%20(Spring%202017)/HW%208%20BANK/AccountApplication.java). Which allows for the user to create a checking, savings, money market or certificate of deposit account and perform transactions on that account as well as get information on both account value and transaction history.
