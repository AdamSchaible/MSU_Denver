This repository contains my programming projects and programming homework for the CS 1050 Computer Science 1 class that I took at MSU Denver in spring of 2017. Below is a general description about what each project or homework is about. The programs in this repository is written in Java.

[HW 4 BIRD PROJECT](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201050%20Computer%20Science%201%20(Spring%202017)/HW%204%20BIRD%20PROJECT) :
Users can simulate simulate some of the things that most flying birds can do through. The user will assign the bird a name, size, flying speed, weight and current elevation and after the bird has been assigned these properties the properties can be changed by calling upon methods that make the bird do certian things, such as eat, fly up or fly down. Users also can change the birds name or size, flying speed, weight or elevation. There are also methods that the user can call on to tell the user what the properties of the bird are.

[HW 5 HEATER PROJECT](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201050%20Computer%20Science%201%20(Spring%202017)/HW%205%20HEATER%20PROJECT) :
Creates a graphical user interface that displays the temperatures of two thermostats after one is turned up and another is turned down using a heating and a cooling method.

[HW 6 SALARY PROJECT](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201050%20Computer%20Science%201%20(Spring%202017)/HW%206%20SALARY%20PROJECT) :
Calculates a workers salary in dollars. Worker enters the number of days that they worked and it is assumed that the worker earns one penny for each day that they work.

[HW 7 LOOP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201050%20Computer%20Science%201%20(Spring%202017)/HW%207%20LOOP) :
The user enters in a line and a character in which they want to know how many times that character is present in the string. After the program has counted the number of times that the character appeared in the line it returns that value to the user.

[HW 8 BANK](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201050%20Computer%20Science%201%20(Spring%202017)/HW%208%20BANK) : 
Allows user to create a checking, savings, money market or certificate of deposit account and perform transactions on that account as well as get information on both account value and transaction history.
