This repository contains my programming homeworks for the CS 1050 Computer Science 1 class that I took at MSU Denver in spring of 2017. Below is a general description about what each programming homework is about. The programs in this repository are written in Java.

[HW 5 HEATER PROJECT](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201050%20Computer%20Science%201%20(Spring%202017)/HW%205%20HEATER%20PROJECT) :
Creates a graphical user interface that displays the temperatures of two thermostats after one is turned up and another is turned down using a heating and a cooling method.

[HW 6 SALARY PROJECT](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201050%20Computer%20Science%201%20(Spring%202017)/HW%206%20SALARY%20PROJECT) :
Calculates a workers salary in dollars. Worker enters the number of days that they worked and it is assumed that the worker earns one penny for the first day and for each following day that days wage is double the previous day.

[HW 7 LOOP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201050%20Computer%20Science%201%20(Spring%202017)/HW%207%20LOOP) :
The user enters in a line and a character in which they want to know how many times that character is present in the string. After the program has counted the number of times that the character appeared in the line it returns that value to the user.

[HW 8 BANK](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201050%20Computer%20Science%201%20(Spring%202017)/HW%208%20BANK) : 
Allows user to create a checking, savings, money market or certificate of deposit account and perform transactions on that account as well as get information on both account value and transaction history.
