**HOMEWORK TITLE:** Homework 9

**HOMEWORK DESCRIPTION:**

Was about writing a program that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to generate the forwarding table for the source router that results in the the shortest router path from the source router to a destination router in a network. The forwarding table is derived from a text file that contains the cost of traveling from one router to its neighboring routers. At the end of the program the forwarding table is displayed. This program is written in Python.

The full homework description and requirements are in [HW9_CS3700.pdf](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203700%20Computer%20Networks%20(Spring%202020)/HW9/HW9_CS3700.pdf).

Within this directory is a folder named tests that contains the topo.txt files that I made to test the test the homework9.py to see how it would respond to topo.txt files with various errors.
