**ASSIGNMENT TITLE:** Assignment 4 - Random Number Generators

**ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:**

This assignment consisted of comparing two different random number generators of my own choice. One of the random numbers had to be from a programming language of my choice and the other random number generator I had to make my myself. My random number generator made numbers through taking the modulus of a fixed number of bytes from a sound file.
