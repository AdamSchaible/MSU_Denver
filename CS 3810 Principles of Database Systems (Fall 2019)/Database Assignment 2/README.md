**ASSIGNMENT TITLE:** Database Assignment 2

**ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:**

In this assignment the data from the [Inpatient Prospective Payment System(IPPS)](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Inpatient/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3) is loaded into a MySQL database named ipps.  The ipps database is designed so that all of its tables are normalized up to 3NF (third normal form).  All Data Definition Language (DDL) SQL statements (CREATE DATABASE and CREATE TABLE statements) and DCL (Data Control Language) statements (CREATE USER, GRANT statements) are present in a file named ipps.sql.  The ippsâ€™s tables of the database are normalized up to 3NF, have primary keys, and appropriate foreign keys with referential integrity constraints in place. 

All files related to this assignment are contained in this directory.
