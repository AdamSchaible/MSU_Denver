Good job! Below are the problems.

(1) (-2 points) the display in 3.2 & 4.6 is not following the requirement: up to 5 columns per sub-matrix.

(1) (-2 points) a yes to "Would you like to continued for the next query?" does not make it loop back for another query, neither does "Y" and "Yes", or "y".

(2) (-1 point) An "not autorized" is displayed in a 7.3 case, which is incorrect since this is simply a query on all permissions that a user has.

(3) (-4 points) In a query described in Step 7.5, this program does not display all the rights that this user has regarding the given object, but a "authorized" message. This is incorrect.

(4) (-2 points) the validation in step 7.4 for object is incorrect.

(5) (-2 points) this program can only catch the first error described in Step 2.2, not the rest. Also, the program crashes after the only error is fixed.

(6) (-6 points) this program can only catch the first error described in Step 6.1 correctly, not the rest.

Also, "U5      R1      R5      R4" could pass a contraint rule "Constraint 1, n = 3, set of roles = {R1, R2, R4, R5}", which is incorrect.
