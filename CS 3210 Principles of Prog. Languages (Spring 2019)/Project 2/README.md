**PROJECT TITLE:** Project 2

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

Consists of several small programs that are written in Lisp. Programs include the following.

1) A program named [N-FACTORIAL.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/N-FACTORIAL.LISP)  that computes the factorial of a positive integer

2) A program named [Search.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/Search.LISP) that tells you how many times a number is in a list

3) A program named [divide-by-3-counter.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/divide-by-3-counter.LISP) that tells you how many numbers in a list are divisible by 3

4) A program named [has-duplicates.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/has-duplicates.LISP)  that tells you whether your list has duplicates

5) A program named [remove-negatives.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/remove-negatives.LISP) that removes all negatives from a list and returns that list.

6) A program named [Temperature Conversion.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/Temperature%20Conversion.LISP) that converts Celcius to Fahrenheit or vice versa

7) A program named [count-groups.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/count-groups.LISP) that counts groups when given a list of words and / or numbers, not nested, counts the number of groups (a group is two or more identical adjacent items).

8) A program named [sort-by-recency.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/sort-by-recency.LISP)  that sorts by recency. Takes a word and a list of words, not nested. If the word is not in the list, it is added at the beginning of the list.  If the word is in the list, its position is changed to be first in the list.

9) A program named [enforce-upper-limit.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/enforce-upper-limit.LISP) that compares numbers in a list to an upper limit. If the number in the list is above the limit then that number is replaced by the limit.

10) A program named [twin.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/twin.LISP) that doubles all elements in a list.

11) A program named [expression-syntax-checker.LISP](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%202/expression-syntax-checker.LISP) that acts as a syntax checker for an incoming list, for details on all of the syntax rules that are checked follow the Project link for more information.

**PROBLEMS THAT NEED ADDRESSING:** ----

**USER INSTRUCTIONS:** 
If you do not allready have a LISP intrepreter to run LISP you can install a LISP intrepreter from [LISPWORKS](http://www.lispworks.com/) using their installation directions. The [LISPWORKS DOCUMENTATION](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/index.html) will show you how to run LISP programs on LISPWORKS.
