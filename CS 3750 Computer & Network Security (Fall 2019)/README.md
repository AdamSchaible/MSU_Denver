This repository contains my programming projects for the CS 3750 Computer & Network Security class that I took at MSU Denver in Fall of 2019. All the projects were written in Java. Below is a general description about what each programming project or programming homework is about. 

[HW 2](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%203750%20Computer%20%26%20Network%20Security%20(Fall%202019)/HW%202) :

Consisted of writing two Java programs, one for encryption and the other for decryption, to implement the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA).

[HW 7](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%203750%20Computer%20%26%20Network%20Security%20(Fall%202019)/HW%207) :

Consisted of writing a Java program to implement a simplified NIST RBAC model.

[HW 9](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%203750%20Computer%20%26%20Network%20Security%20(Fall%202019)/HW%209) :

Consisted of writing a client Java program and a server Java program to implement a secure information collection protocol on top of SSL/TLS service.

[Project 1](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%203750%20Computer%20%26%20Network%20Security%20(Fall%202019)/Project%201) :

Consisted of writing three independent programs in three separate directories: a key generation program, a sender’s program, and a receiver’s program, in order to implement a Public Key encrypted message and its digital digest.
