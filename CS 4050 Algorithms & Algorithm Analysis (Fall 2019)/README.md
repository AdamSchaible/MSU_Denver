This repository contains my programming assignments for the CS 4050 Algorithms & Algorithm Analysis class that I took at MSU Denver in Fall of 2019. Below is a general description about what each programming assignment is about. 

[Assignment 1 - Timing Quicksort](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%204050%20Algorithms%20%26%20Algorithm%20Analysis%20(Fall%202019)/Assignment%201%20-%20Timing%20Quicksort) :

Involved using Java to time various methods of sorting to see which method was the fastest one. The methods that were timed included Quicksort, QuickSort with a median of 3, Hoares, Lomato and Insertion Sort with a possibility of various region sizes. The fastest one ended up being the median of 3. After the comparison was done I wrote up a paper about this. More information is available in the assignment 1 link.

[Assignment 2 - Word Tree Dictionary Lookup](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%204050%20Algorithms%20%26%20Algorithm%20Analysis%20(Fall%202019)/Assignment%202%20-%20Word%20Tree%20Dictionary%20Lookup) :

This assignment involved creating a tree structure in a Java program that held all the words of a dictionary. When the program ran it would take in the keystrokes from the user and guess what words the user was typing though navigating the dictionary tree each time a new letter was typed.

[Assignment 3 - Probabilistic Algorithms](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%204050%20Algorithms%20%26%20Algorithm%20Analysis%20(Fall%202019)/Assignment%203%20-%20Probabilistic%20Algorithms) :

This assignment consisted of writing up the following programs

1) A program to compute Î  (Pi) probablistically using a circle contained inside a square and having darts thrown within that square.

2) A program that uses the generation of random numbers to see if a number is a prime.

3) A program that would search an array of a 1000 members and compute on average how many random guesses it would take to find a member in that array without knowing that members exact location in the array.

4) A program that can do Monte Carlo Intregration through using dart throwing, by taking the mean of values at random locations or by using the trapezoid method.

5) Solving the [8 queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)  by having a different numbers of queens initially glued to the chessboard and solving the placing of the remaining queens to the chessboard though backtracking and timing how long the whole process takes. The times were compared to see what number of queens initially glued to the chessboard allowed for the 8 queens problem to be solved the quickest.

[Assignment 4 -Random Number Generators](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%204050%20Algorithms%20%26%20Algorithm%20Analysis%20(Fall%202019)/Assignment%204%20-Random%20Number%20Generators) :

This assignment consisted of comparing two different random number generators of my own choice. One of the random numbers had to be from a programming language of my choice and the other random number generator I had to make my myself. My random number generator made numbers through taking the modulus of a fixed number of bytes from a sound file.

[Assignment 5 - Graph](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%204050%20Algorithms%20%26%20Algorithm%20Analysis%20(Fall%202019)/Assignment%205%20-%20%20Graph) :
"1. build a directed weighted graph that represents exchange rates. Each node of the graph represents a currency (such as dollars) and each directed weighted edge represents the exchange rate (the edge weight is what you multiply the from-node by to get the corresponding amount of currency in the to-node). 
2. find sequences of trades that will result in a profit. Print out the trades and the resulting profit if $1000 is invested (or 1000 of the currency that you start with)."
