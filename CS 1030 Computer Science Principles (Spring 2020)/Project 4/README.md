**PROJECT TITLE:** Project 4

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

Consists of three seperate programs.

The first program that reads a list of words from a text file and calculates the Scrabbleâ„¢ point value of each word in the text file and displays the point value of each word to the user. The first program is named [AdamSchaible 03 04 01.py](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%204/AdamSchaible%2003%2004%2001.py).

The second program reads sentences from a text file and displays a count of how many times each letter of alphabet was found in the text file and returns that count to the user. This programs uses a dictionary to keep track of letter frequencies. The second program is named [AdamSchaible 03 04 02.py](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%204/AdamSchaible%2003%2004%2002.py).

The third program can either copy a single text file and write to an output text file or it can concatenate serveral text files together and write it to a single output text file as it reads each text file line by line. The third program is named [AdamSchaible 03 04 03.py](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%204/AdamSchaible%2003%2004%2003.py).

The full project description and requirements are in [1030 Project 04 Specification.docx](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%204/1030%20Project%2004%20Specification.docx).

All files related to this project are contained in this directory.

In this directory are text files that begin with "1030 Project 04..." and these files are read by the Python programs in this project as described in the [1030 Project 04 Specification.docx](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%201030%20Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%204/1030%20Project%2004%20Specification.docx).
