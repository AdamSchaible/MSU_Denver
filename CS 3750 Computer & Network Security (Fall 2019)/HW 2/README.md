All files related to this homework are contained in this directory.

The full homework description and requirements are in [HW2_CS3750.pdf](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203750%20Computer%20%26%20Network%20Security%20(Fall%202019)/HW%202/HW2_CS3750.pdf).

**VERSION or DATE:** 09/01/2019

**PROBLEMS THAT NEED ADDRESSING:** 
1) R1, L2, and R2 calculated by the Encryption program are incorrect.

2) L1, L0, and R0 calculated by the Decryption program are incorrect.

**USER INSTRUCTIONS:** 

1) Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if you do not allready have Java Development Kit 8 or a latter version allready installed on your computer. For installation help see [Oracle's Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2) Run the following commands in your terminal or command line in the directory containing this README file to run the program and if you need additional help doing this see [How to Compile and Run your First Java Program](https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/first-java-program/).
