**ASSIGNMENT TITLE:** Assignment 5 Graph

**ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:**

"1. build a directed weighted graph that represents exchange rates. Each node of the graph represents a currency (such as dollars) and each directed weighted edge represents the exchange rate (the edge weight is what you multiply the from-node by to get the corresponding amount of currency in the to-node). 
2. find sequences of trades that will result in a profit. Print out the trades and the resulting profit if $1000 is invested (or 1000 of the currency that you start with)." *- quoted from full project description thats below*
