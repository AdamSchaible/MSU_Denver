This repository contains my programming homeworks for the CS 3700 Computer Networks class that I took at MSU Denver in Spring of 2020. Below is a general description about what each programming homework is about. 

[HW2](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%203700%20Computer%20Networks%20(Spring%202020)/HW2) :

Consisted of writing a client program and a server program to implement a protocol on top of UDP in Java. For more information about the protocol used and the project itself click on the project link.

[HW3](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%203700%20Computer%20Networks%20(Spring%202020)/HW3) :

Consisted of writing a client program and a server program to implement the a simplified HTTP protocol based on TCP service. The server was written to support multiple clients. Both client and server program were written in Java. For more information about the HTTP protocol used and the project itself click on the project link.

[HW4](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%203700%20Computer%20Networks%20(Spring%202020)/HW4) :

Consisted of writing a SMTP client program and a SMTP server program to implement the a simplified SMTP protocol based on TCP service. Server was written to support multiple clients. Both client and server were written in Java. For more information about the simplified SMTP protocol used and the project itself click on the project link.

[HW9](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%203700%20Computer%20Networks%20(Spring%202020)/HW9) :

Was about writing a program that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to generate the forwarding table for the source router that results in the the shortest router path from the source router to a destination router in a network. The forwarding table is derived from a text file that contains the cost of traveling from one router to its neighboring routers. At the end of the program the forwarding table is displayed. This program is written in Python.
