The Dictionary Lookup is designed to do a search through the dictionary located in a file called words.txt in this same folder and will return up to 10 predications for the word the user is attempting to type. The predications will only include words that are already present in the dictionary. To run the program compile and run the DictionaryGUI.java. DictionaryGUI.java depends on the other Java files in this folder in order to run.
