This repository contains my programming projects for the CS 1030 Computer Science Principles class that I took at MSU Denver in spring of 2020. Below is a general description about what each project is about. Each of the projects in this repository is written in Python with version 3.

[PROJECT 1](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201030%20%09Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%201) : 
Consists of three separate programs. 

The first program converts a height in feet to meters. 

The second program converts miles per gallon to kilometers per liter. 

The third program outputs the color of a square on a chessboard when given a chessboard coordinate.

[ PROJECT 2](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201030%20%09Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%202) :

Consists of two separate programs. 

The first program computes a grade point average when at least one grade is given. 

The second program is a coin flipping program that counts the number of times a coin is flipped in order to get either three heads or three tails in a row and displays the average number of flips, the minimum number of flips and maximum number of flips based on how many coin flipping simulations the user tells the program to run. 

[PROJECT 3](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201030%20%09Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%203) :

Consists of three separate programs.

The first program generates a temperature conversion table for Celcius and Fahrenheit using loops.

The second program takes in numbers from a user and puts them in a list. When the user enters zero the program takes the numbers in the list and displays all of the numbers that are below the average, that equal the average, and that are above the average.

[PROJECT 4](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%201030%20%09Computer%20Science%20Principles%20(Spring%202020)/Project%204) :

Consists of three seperate programs.

The first program that reads a list of words from a text file and calculates the Scrabbleâ„¢ point value of each word in the text file and displays the point value of each word to the user.

The second program reads sentences from a text file and displays a count of how many times each letter of alphabet was found in the text file and returns that count to the user. This programs uses a dictionary to keep track of letter frequencies.

The third program can either copy a single text file and write to an output text file or it can concatenate serveral text files together and write it to a single output text file as it reads each text file line by line.
