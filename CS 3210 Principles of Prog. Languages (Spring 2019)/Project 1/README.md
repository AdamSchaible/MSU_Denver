**PROJECT TITLE:** Project 1

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

This project takes a MAL (minimal assembly language) program, and runs the first steps of a preprocessor / translator (assembler): removing comments and checking for syntax errors. The program processes the code, and creates a report file with error messages (if any) and a comments-removed listing of the code. This was programmed using Python.

All files related to this project are contained in this directory.

The full project description and requirements are in [MAL project specs.doc](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%203210%20Principles%20of%20Prog.%20Languages%20(Spring%202019)/Project%201/MAL%20project%20specs.doc).
