This repository contains my programming project for the CS 3600 Operating Systems class that I took at MSU Denver in Spring of 2019. Below is a general description about that programming project that I did in this class. 

[PRODUCER CONSUMER PROJECT](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/tree/master/CS%203600%20Operating%20Systems%20(Spring%202019)) :

This project is based on the [Producer–Consumer Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem).
 
The project’s theme centers around gold miners as the producers and the customers as the consumers of the gold. The gold miners continue to put gold into the vault in the form of gold coins only as long as there is space in the vault and the customers have the bank clerks get their gold coins for them from the vault as long as there are sufficient gold coins in the vault. If there is not sufficient gold coins in the vault then the bank clerk will not fulfill the customers request for gold coins at that time. The vault serves as a buffer for the gold coins.
