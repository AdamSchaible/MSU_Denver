**ASSIGNMENT TITLE:** Assignment 3 - Probablistic Algorithms

**ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:**

This assignment consisted of writing up the following programs

1)[Pi.java](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%204050%20Algorithms%20%26%20Algorithm%20Analysis%20(Fall%202019)/Assignment%203%20-%20Probabilistic%20Algorithms/Pi.java)   computes Î  (Pi) probablistically using a circle contained inside a square and having darts thrown within that square.

2) [TestingForPrimeNumbers.java](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%204050%20Algorithms%20%26%20Algorithm%20Analysis%20(Fall%202019)/Assignment%203%20-%20Probabilistic%20Algorithms/TestingForPrimeNumbers.java)  uses the generation of random numbers to see if a number is a prime.

3) [SearchingAnArray.java](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%204050%20Algorithms%20%26%20Algorithm%20Analysis%20(Fall%202019)/Assignment%203%20-%20Probabilistic%20Algorithms/SearchingAnArray.java) searchs an array of a 1000 members and computes an average how many random guesses it would take to find a member in that array without knowing that members exact location in the array.

4) [MonteCarloIntegration.java](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%204050%20Algorithms%20%26%20Algorithm%20Analysis%20(Fall%202019)/Assignment%203%20-%20Probabilistic%20Algorithms/MonteCarloIntegration.java) can do Monte Carlo Intregration through using dart throwing, by taking the mean of values at random locations or by using the trapezoid method.

5) [QueensTest.java](https://github.com/AdamSchaible/MSU_Denver/blob/master/CS%204050%20Algorithms%20%26%20Algorithm%20Analysis%20(Fall%202019)/Assignment%203%20-%20Probabilistic%20Algorithms/QueensTest.java)  solves the [8 queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)  by having a different numbers of queens initially glued to the chessboard and solving the placing of the remaining queens to the chessboard though backtracking and timing how long the whole process takes. The times were compared to see what number of queens initially glued to the chessboard allowed for the 8 queens problem to be solved the quickest.
