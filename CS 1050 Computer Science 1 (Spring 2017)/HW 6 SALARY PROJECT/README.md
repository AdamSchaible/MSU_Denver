**HOMEWORK TITLE:** HW 6 SALARY PROJECT

**HOMEWORK DESCRIPTION:**
To write a java program that calculates a workers salary in dollars. The user enters the number of days that they worked and it is assumed that the worker earns one penny for the first day and for each following day that days wage is double the previous day. For each day display the current wage and the total accumulation of money earned by the worker. Use integers for the days worked, daily salary and total pay.

**VERSION or DATE:** 06/29/20

**PROBLEMS THAT NEED ADDRESSING:** None

**NOTES:** 

The current version is an upgrade from verion 04/02/17. Changes include setting the maximum number of days which one can calculate to 31 so that the salary does not exceed the maximum value of an integer and users are now prompted to re-enter the number of days if they do not enter a proper value, rather than letting the program crash.

**USER INSTRUCTIONS:** 

1) Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if you do not already have Java Development Kit 8 or a latter version allready installed on your computer. For installation help see [Oracle's Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2) Run the following commands in your terminal or command line in the directory containing this README file to run the program and if you need additional help doing this see [How to Compile and Run your First Java Program](https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/first-java-program/).
